# Relay Configuration

## Hydraulic System Control
Relay assignments for LifeTrac 25 hydraulic functions:

## Relay Mapping
- **Relay 1**: Boom lift cylinder
- **Relay 2**: Boom lower cylinder  
- **Relay 3**: Bucket curl cylinder
- **Relay 4**: Bucket dump cylinder
- **Relay 5**: Left track forward
- **Relay 6**: Left track reverse
- **Relay 7**: Right track forward
- **Relay 8**: Right track reverse
- **Relay 9**: Auxiliary hydraulic 1
- **Relay 10**: Auxiliary hydraulic 2
- **Relay 11**: Emergency stop (safety relay)
- **Relay 12**: System enable (master relay)

## Safety Configuration
- All relays default to OFF state
- Emergency stop relay controls master system power
- Watchdog timer automatically disables system if communication is lost
- Failsafe relay configurations prevent dangerous states

## Control Logic
- Momentary activation for most functions
- Interlock logic prevents conflicting operations
- Speed control through PWM where applicable
