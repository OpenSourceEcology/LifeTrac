# Safety Guidelines for LifeTrac

## General Safety Principles

**WARNING**: The designs in this repository are for educational and research purposes. Building and operating machinery based on these designs carries inherent risks. Always consult with qualified professionals and follow local safety regulations.

## Design Safety Requirements

### Structural Safety
- All structural components must meet appropriate safety factors
- Use proper materials and fasteners for intended loads
- Consider fatigue and wear over time
- Include redundant safety systems where critical

### Hydraulic System Safety
- Install pressure relief valves on all hydraulic circuits
- Use proper hydraulic hoses rated for system pressure
- Include hydraulic system isolation capabilities
- Provide clear hydraulic system documentation

### Operator Safety
- Design operator controls to be easily accessible and visible
- Include emergency stop systems
- Provide clear operator sight lines
- Consider operator ergonomics and fatigue

### Electronic System Safety (V3, V4)
- Use appropriate electrical enclosures and protection
- Include emergency shutdown capabilities
- Follow electrical safety standards
- Provide proper grounding and isolation

## Autonomous System Safety (V4)

### Human Override
- Always maintain human override capability
- Include visual and audible alerts for autonomous operation
- Provide clear indication of system status
- Enable immediate operator takeover

### Fail-Safe Design
- System must fail to a safe state
- Include multiple independent safety systems
- Implement watchdog timers and monitoring
- Test all failure modes thoroughly

### Environmental Awareness
- Include obstacle detection and avoidance
- Implement geofencing and boundary systems
- Consider weather and environmental conditions
- Provide emergency communication capabilities

## Manufacturing and Assembly Safety

### Workshop Safety
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Follow proper welding and fabrication safety procedures
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Use proper lifting and handling techniques

### Testing and Commissioning
- Test all systems before operation
- Start with controlled, low-risk environments
- Have qualified personnel supervise initial testing
- Document all test procedures and results

## Operational Safety

### Pre-Operation Checks
- Inspect all systems before each use
- Verify proper fluid levels and pressures
- Check all safety systems and controls
- Ensure operator is properly trained

### Safe Operating Procedures
- Follow manufacturer recommendations for components
- Operate within design specifications
- Maintain proper maintenance schedules
- Keep detailed operational logs

### Emergency Procedures
- Develop and practice emergency procedures
- Ensure all operators know shutdown procedures
- Provide emergency contact information
- Have appropriate fire suppression available

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance

### Local Regulations
- Check local machinery operation regulations
- Ensure compliance with agricultural equipment standards
- Consider insurance and liability requirements
- Obtain necessary permits and certifications

### Standards Compliance
- Follow relevant ISO, ANSI, or local standards
- Consider ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structure) requirements
- Implement appropriate safety labeling
- Document compliance with applicable standards

## Risk Assessment

Before building or operating any LifeTrac design:

1. **Identify Hazards**: List all potential hazards and risks
2. **Assess Risk**: Evaluate probability and severity of each risk
3. **Mitigate Risk**: Implement appropriate safety measures
4. **Document**: Keep detailed records of safety analysis
5. **Review**: Regularly review and update safety measures
