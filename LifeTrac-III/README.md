# LifeTrac III

**Alternative Name:** Third LifeTrac Iteration  
**Wiki Reference:** [LifeTrac III](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_III)

## Overview

LifeTrac III is the third iteration of the LifeTrac series. It closely matches LifeTrac II, but with significant modifications:
- 18" shorter overall length
- Single (front-end) loader arm instead of dual loaders
- 32 cu in hydraulic motors
- Quick attach valves added

## Key Features

- **Design Base:** Modified LifeTrac II design
- **Size:** Compact design - 18" shorter than LifeTrac II
- **Loader Configuration:** Single front-end loader arm
- **Hydraulic Motors:** 32 cu in hydraulic motors
- **Hydraulic System:** Quick attach valves for improved functionality
- **Construction:** Same skid steer design philosophy as LifeTrac II

## Design Status (as of 2011)

- Several prototypes have been built and tested
- Comprehensive documentation available as part of Civilization Starter Kit DVD v0.01
- Bill of Materials created (completeness under review)
- Testing revealed need for LifeTrac IV to address safety concerns and improve capabilities

## Documentation Resources

The LifeTrac III is extensively documented in the Civilization Starter Kit DVD v0.01:

- 4.1 Tractor Design Rationale, Product Ecology
- 4.2 Tractor Master CAD File
- 4.3 Tractor Bill of Materials
- 4.3-4.4 Tractor Fabrication Manual
- 4.5 Tractor Assembly (full assembly video - 12 min)
- 4.6 Tractor Fabrication Drawings
- 4.7 Tractor User Manual
- 4.8 Quality Control Checklist

## Historical Significance

LifeTrac III represents the refinement of the modular Power Cube concept with improved hydraulic systems and more compact design. The lessons learned from this version directly informed the development of LifeTrac IV.
