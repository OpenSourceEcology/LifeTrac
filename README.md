# LifeTrac
**Skidded Tractor For Everyday Use**

## Overview

This repository contains multiple versions of CAD designs for the LifeTrac tractor, an open-source skidded tractor designed for everyday agricultural and land management use. The repository is organized by version and control system type, supporting evolution from manual operation to semi-autonomous systems.

## Version Types

### Manual Hydraulic (V2)
Standard manual hydraulic valve controls for traditional operation. These versions provide reliable, field-tested designs suitable for immediate production and use.

### Solenoid Remote Control (V3)
Remote-controlled solenoid valves that enable operator control from a distance. This serves as a bridge technology toward autonomous systems.

### Semi-Autonomous (V4)
GPS and camera-based control systems for semi-autonomous operation. These versions represent the future of automated farming equipment with human oversight capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Versions**: Explore the [versions/](./versions/) directory to find the appropriate design for your needs
2. **Read Documentation**: Each version includes comprehensive documentation and specifications
3. **Download CAD Files**: Access complete CAD files in standard formats (STEP, STL, etc.)
4. **Follow Assembly**: Use provided assembly instructions and documentation

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to all versions and experimental designs:

1. **Adding New Designs**: Create version-specific directories following the established structure
2. **Improving Existing Versions**: Submit improvements to CAD files, documentation, or assembly instructions
3. **Experimental Work**: Share research and experimental designs in the experimental directory
4. **Documentation**: Help improve documentation, specifications, and user guides

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the established directory structure for consistency
- Include comprehensive documentation with all designs
- Provide CAD files in multiple standard formats when possible
- Update relevant README files with your contributions
- Consider safety implications and include appropriate warnings
