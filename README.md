## Genealogy

* [LifeTrac I](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_I) - 2008 - Articulated steering, 4 wheel drive, wheel chains, dedicated 55 hp diesel engine. Limited roll-over protection.
* [LifeTrac II](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_II) - Began modular Power Cube design. Skid steering with tracks on rubber tires, 4 wheel drive, 2 modular engine units (Power Cubes), 54 hp total, front- and rear-end loaders included.
* [LifeTrac III](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_III) - Same as II but one single (front-end) loader arm. 32 cu in hydraulic motors. Quick attach valves added.
* [LifeTrac IV](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_IV) - Larger hydraulic motors (45 cu in) were used, and Modular Wheel Units were added. Quick connects added to hydraulic controls.
* [LifeTrac V](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_V) - Began using LifeTrac Construction Set - 4"x4" square tubing, and increased modularity of construction. Modular Wheel Units continued.
* [LifeTrac VI](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_VI) - Continued LifeTrac Construction Set. Modular Wheel Units are a robust design feature. Same design, but fixed the loader arm geometry.
* [LifeTrac VII](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_VII) - First tracked version built. Continuing Tractor Construction Set with Bulldozer Development.
* [LifeTrac v16](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_v16) (LifeTrac VIII) - 2016 - Tracked tractor designed purely as a simplified traction machine with 7000 lb of pull.
* [Microtrac v17.10](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/MicroTrac_v17.10) (LifeTrac IX) - In use in 2021 but modified to shorter tracks.
* [LifeTrac v17.10](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_v17.10) - Universal Wheel Unit no longer the main drive option to promote 5 Minute Part Replacement.
* [LifeTrac v20.12](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_v20.12) - Built during Summer X 2021. Includes work on UTU and UWU. Test bed for 5 Minute Part Replacement.
