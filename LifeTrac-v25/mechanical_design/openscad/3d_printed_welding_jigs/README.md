## Jig Descriptions

### 1. Tube Drilling Jig (`tube_drilling_jig.scad`)

**Purpose:** Wraps around 2"×6" rectangular tubing to accurately mark bolt hole centers for angle iron mounting brackets.

**Dimensions:**
- Outer: ~3" × 7" (76.2mm × 177.8mm)
- Length: 4" (101.6mm)
- Fits 2"×6" tubing with 0.5mm clearance

**Features:**
- 4 guide holes (2 per narrow face) for center punch or marker
- Guide hole diameter: 1/4" (6.35mm) - fits standard center punch
- Hole spacing: 2" (50.8mm) apart vertically, centered on tube height
- Center alignment cross and text markings for tape measure reference
- U-shape design slides onto tube from top

**Variants:**
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `tube_drilling_jig()` | Standard version with punch-sized holes |
| `tube_drilling_jig_marker_version()` | Larger 3/8" holes for marker tips |
| `tube_drilling_jig_minimal()` | Smaller 2" long version, faster to print |

**Recommended Quantity:** Print **4-6 copies** to mark all holes on a tube simultaneously.

**Usage:**
1. Measure desired hole position from tube end
2. Slide jig onto tube, align CENTER mark with tape measure
3. Mark through guide holes using center punch (tap with hammer) or marker
4. Remove jig and drill at marked centers with 1/2" bit

### 2. Pivot Mount Welding Jig (`pivot_mount_welding_jig.scad`)

**Purpose:** Holds circular plates and DOM tube in alignment during welding of the pivot mount assembly.

**Features:**
- Maintains correct spacing between plates (arm tube width)
- Centers DOM tube on both plates
- Keeps plates perpendicular to DOM tube
- Provides access gaps for welding torch

**Key Parameters:**
- Plate diameter: ~6" (152.4mm)
- Plate spacing: 2" (50.8mm) - matches arm tube width
- DOM pipe alignment cradle

**Recommended Quantity:** Print **1 set** (base + alignment components).

---

### 3. Pivot Welding Jig (`pivot_welding_jig.scad`)

**Purpose:** Simple alignment jig for holding two plates at the correct spacing while welding.

**Features:**
- Maintains 2" (50.8mm) gap between plates
- DOM pipe alignment cutout
- Minimal material design

**Recommended Quantity:** Print **2 copies** for opposite ends.

---

## Printing Recommendations

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Material | PLA or PETG |
| Layer Height | 0.2mm |
| Infill | 20-30% |
| Walls | 3 perimeters minimum |
| Supports | May be needed for overhangs |

### Print Orientation
- **Tube Drilling Jig:** Opening facing up (standing on the 7" face)
- **Pivot Jigs:** Flat side down

## Customization

All jigs pull dimensions from `lifetrac_v25_params.scad` when available, with sensible defaults if run standalone.

### Adjustable Parameters

**Tube Drilling Jig:**
```openscad
JIG_CLEARANCE = 0.5;       // Increase for looser fit, decrease for snug
GUIDE_HOLE_DIA = 6.35;     // 1/4" punch, change for different tools
JIG_LENGTH = 101.6;        // 4", can reduce for faster printing
```

**Pivot Welding Jigs:**
```openscad
JIG_WALL_THICKNESS = 4;    // Wall thickness
JIG_CLEARANCE = 0.5;       // Fit clearance
WELD_ACCESS_GAP = 25;      // Gap for welder access
```
