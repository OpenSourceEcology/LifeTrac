### assembly.png
![Assembly Preview](assembly.png)

A 3D rendered view of the complete LifeTrac v25 assembly (1024×768px). This image is automatically generated by GitHub Actions whenever the OpenSCAD files are updated. It provides a quick visual reference of the overall design.

### cnclayout.svg

A 2D vector layout of all plate steel parts organized for CNC plasma cutting. Parts are:
- Color-coded by thickness (blue = 1/4", red = 1/2")
- Labeled with part numbers and descriptions
- Laid out with proper spacing for cutting
- All corners pre-rounded to 6.35mm radius

This file can be imported into CAM software (SheetCAM, etc.) for generating G-code.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenSCAD** - Download from [openscad.org](https://openscad.org/)
   - Version 2021.01 or newer recommended

2. **Optional Tools:**
   - FreeCAD for DXF editing
   - Python 3 for automation scripts

### Viewing the Design

1. Open OpenSCAD
2. Load `openscad/lifetrac_v25.scad`
3. Press F5 for preview or F6 for full render
4. Use the animation controls (View → Animate) to see moving parts

### Animation

The design includes animation for:
- Loader arm lift (0-60 degrees)
- Bucket tilt (0-90 degrees)
- Wheel rotation

Enable animation: View → Animate → FPS: 10, Steps: 100

### Customization

Edit parameters at the top of `lifetrac_v25.scad`:

```openscad
// Display options
show_wheels = true;
show_hydraulics = true;
show_frame = true;
show_loader_arms = true;
show_bucket = true;
show_standing_deck = true;
exploded_view = false;

// Machine dimensions (in mm)
MACHINE_WIDTH = 1200;
MACHINE_LENGTH = 1800;
WHEEL_DIAMETER = 500;
// ... and more
```

## Manufacturing Outputs

### DXF Export (CNC Cutting)

For 2D parts (plates), export individual parts:

```bash
openscad -o output/dxf/wheel_mounting_plate.dxf modules/plate_steel.scad
```

Or use the batch export script:

```bash
./export_all_cnc_parts.sh
```

### PNG Rendering

```bash
openscad -o output/renders/lifetrac_v25.png --camera=2000,2000,1500,0,0,0 \
         --imgsize=1920,1080 openscad/lifetrac_v25.scad
```

## Automated Workflows

GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Validates OpenSCAD syntax on every commit
2. Generates assembly.png (3D render of complete assembly)
3. Generates cnclayout.svg (2D layout for CNC cutting)
4. Renders preview images from multiple angles
5. Generates assembly animations

See `.github/workflows/openscad-render.yml` for details.

## Materials

### Plate Steel

- **1/2" (12.7mm):** High-stress areas, wheel mounts, pivots
- **Corner Radius:** 6.35mm (1/4") standard on all plates

### Structural Steel
- **4"×4"×1/4" Square Tubing:** Main frame (OSE standard)
- **3"×3"×1/4" Square Tubing:** Loader arms
- **2"×2"×1/4" Square Tubing:** Secondary supports
- **Angle Iron:** Optional reinforcement

### Fasteners
- **1" Hex Bolts:** Frame connections, pivot pins
- **1/2" Hex Bolts:** General assembly, plate mounting

## Design Philosophy

Following Open Source Ecology principles:

1. **Modularity:** Components can be replaced independently
2. **Standardization:** Common sizes, off-the-shelf parts
3. **Simplicity:** Minimize complexity, maximize reliability
4. **Manufacturability:** Designed for common tools (plasma cutter, welder, drill press)
5. **Open Source:** Fully documented, modifiable, shareable

## Integration with Electronics

This mechanical design integrates with the LifeTrac v25 electronic control system located in the parent directory. The control housing (G1) is sized to accommodate:

- Arduino Opta WiFi controller
- Arduino Opta extensions
- Hydraulic valve controllers
- Wiring and connections

See `../README.md` for electronics documentation.
