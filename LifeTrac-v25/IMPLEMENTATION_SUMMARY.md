# LifeTrac v25 - MQTT/OFF/BLE Switch Implementation Summary

## Issue Requirement

**Original Request:**
> In v25, let's add a hardware switch, a 3 position double throw switch, that will cut off power 12v power to opta in the off position, and select between regular MQTT control or a new option for BLE direct control via the droidpad app. Default to BLE if no switch is installed and the power is on.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements have been fully implemented with comprehensive documentation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Hardware Switch Support ✅

**3-Position Switch Configuration:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Position 1: OFF                │ → 12V power disconnected (hardware cutoff)
│  Position 2: MQTT               │ → WiFi/MQTT control (D9=HIGH)
│  Position 3: BLE (Default)      │ → Bluetooth control (D9=LOW)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pin Assignments:**
- `D9` (MODE_SWITCH_PIN_A) - Mode detection pin
- `D10` (MODE_SWITCH_PIN_B) - Reserved for future use
- Internal pulldown resistors ensure BLE is default when switch not installed

### 2. BLE Direct Control ✅

**Bluetooth Service Implemented:**
- Service UUID: `19B10000-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`
- Device Name: `LifeTrac-v25`
- Two characteristics for joystick control (8 bytes each)

**BLE Characteristics:**
1. Left Joystick: `19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`
   - Bytes 0-3: left_x (float -1.0 to 1.0)
   - Bytes 4-7: left_y (float -1.0 to 1.0)

2. Right Joystick: `19B10002-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`
   - Bytes 0-3: right_x (float -1.0 to 1.0)
   - Bytes 4-7: right_y (float -1.0 to 1.0)

### 3. Default BLE Mode ✅

**When No Switch Installed:**
- Both D9 and D10 read LOW (internal pulldown resistors)
- Controller automatically boots in BLE mode
- Power remains on (direct 12V connection to VIN)
- No configuration needed - works out of the box

### 4. Code Implementation ✅

**New Functions Added:**
```cpp
void readModeSwitch()          // Detects switch position on startup
void setupBLE()                // Initializes BLE service and characteristics
void readBLEJoystickData()     // Reads joystick data from BLE
```

**Modified Functions:**
```cpp
void setup()                   // Added mode detection and BLE initialization
void loop()                    // Added BLE polling and mode-specific logic
```

**New Enumerations:**
```cpp
enum ControlMode {
  MODE_BLE,    // Bluetooth Low Energy direct control
  MODE_MQTT    // WiFi/MQTT control via broker
};
```

### 5. Documentation Created ✅

## Technical Specifications

### Power Management
- **OFF Mode**: Hardware switch disconnects 12V completely
- **MQTT Mode**: Normal 12V power + D9=HIGH
- **BLE Mode**: Normal 12V power + D9=LOW (default)

### Mode Detection Logic
```cpp
pinMode(MODE_SWITCH_PIN_A, INPUT_PULLDOWN);  // D9 with pulldown
pinMode(MODE_SWITCH_PIN_B, INPUT_PULLDOWN);  // D10 with pulldown

if (pinA == HIGH && pinB == LOW) {
  currentMode = MODE_MQTT;
} else {
  currentMode = MODE_BLE;  // Default
}
```

### BLE Implementation
- **Library**: ArduinoBLE (Arduino official)
- **Protocol**: Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0+
- **Range**: 30-100 feet (10-30m) typical
- **Latency**: 20-50ms typical
- **Connection**: Single device at a time
- **Security**: Open (can be enhanced with pairing)

### Safety Features (Both Modes)
- ✅ 10% deadzone on all joystick inputs
- ✅ 1-second safety timeout
- ✅ Emergency stop functionality
- ✅ Input value clamping (-1.0 to 1.0)
- ✅ Automatic stop on disconnect
