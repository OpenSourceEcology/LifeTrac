# LifeTrac v25 - Remote Control System

LifeTrac v25 features a comprehensive remote control system using WiFi and MQTT communication for hydraulic operation control.

## Features

* **Remote Joystick Control:** Dual joystick setup for tank steering and hydraulic functions
* **WiFi Communication:** Reliable wireless control with MQTT protocol
* **Proportional Flow Control:** Speed regulation based on joystick input intensity
* **Safety Features:** Emergency stop, communication timeout, and fail-safe operation
* **Status Monitoring:** Real-time system status and diagnostics

## Control Scheme

### Tank Steering
- **Left Joystick Y-axis:** Forward/backward movement for both tracks
- **Left Joystick X-axis:** Differential steering (left/right turns)

### Hydraulic Functions  
- **Right Joystick Y-axis:** Arms up/down control
- **Right Joystick X-axis:** Bucket up/down control

### Speed Control
- **Proportional Flow Valve:** Automatically adjusts system speed based on maximum joystick input
- **Deadzone:** 10% deadzone prevents unwanted movements from joystick drift
