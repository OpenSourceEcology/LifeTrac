# LifeTrac v25 - Remote Control System

LifeTrac v25 features a comprehensive remote control system with multiple control modes including WiFi/MQTT and direct Bluetooth (BLE) communication for hydraulic operation control.

## Features

* **Multiple Control Modes:** 3-position switch for OFF/MQTT/BLE mode selection (BLE default)
* **BLE Direct Control:** Direct Bluetooth connection to DroidPad app (no WiFi/broker needed)
* **Remote Joystick Control:** Dual joystick setup for tank steering and hydraulic functions
* **DroidPad Compatible:** Native support for DroidPad via BLE or MQTT using -1.0 to 1.0 value range
* **WiFi Communication:** Reliable wireless control with MQTT protocol
* **ROS2 Integration:** Control LifeTrac from BeagleBone or any ROS2-enabled device
* **Proportional Flow Control:** Speed regulation based on joystick input intensity
* **Safety Features:** Emergency stop, communication timeout, and fail-safe operation
* **Status Monitoring:** Real-time system status and diagnostics

## Control Scheme

### Tank Steering
- **Left Joystick Y-axis:** Forward/backward movement for both tracks
- **Left Joystick X-axis:** Differential steering (left/right turns)

### Hydraulic Functions  
- **Right Joystick Y-axis:** Arms up/down control
- **Right Joystick X-axis:** Bucket up/down control

### Speed Control
- **Proportional Flow Valve:** Automatically adjusts system speed based on maximum joystick input
- **Deadzone:** 10% deadzone prevents unwanted movements from joystick drift

# Quick Start

## Option 1: DroidPad via BLE (Simplest - Recommended for Mobile)
1. **Program Arduino Opta:** Upload controller code with BLE support
2. **Set Mode:** Set mode switch to BLE position (or leave switch uninstalled for default BLE)
3. **Connect DroidPad:** Open DroidPad app, scan for "LifeTrac-v25" via Bluetooth
4. **Configure:** Set up BLE characteristics using provided UUIDs
5. **Control:** Start controlling immediately - no WiFi/network needed!

For detailed instructions, see [DROIDPAD_BLE_SETUP.md](DROIDPAD_BLE_SETUP.md).

## Option 2: Raspberry Pi Web Controller (Best for Fixed Installation)
1. **Set up MQTT Broker:** Install Mosquitto on Raspberry Pi using config/mosquitto.conf
2. **Program Arduino Opta:** Upload controller code
3. **Set Mode:** Set mode switch to MQTT position
4. **Install Web Controller:** Run `sudo ./install.sh` in raspberry_pi_web_controller/
5. **Connect Camera:** Attach Arducam IMX335 to Raspberry Pi
6. **Access Interface:** Open `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000` in any browser

For detailed instructions, see [raspberry_pi_web_controller/README.md](raspberry_pi_web_controller/README.md).
