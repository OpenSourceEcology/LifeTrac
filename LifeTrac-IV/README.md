# LifeTrac IV

**Year:** 2012  
**Alternative Name:** Fourth LifeTrac Iteration  
**Wiki Reference:** [LifeTrac IV](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_IV)

## Overview

LifeTrac IV is the fourth iteration of the LifeTrac series, representing a retrofit of existing LifeTrac III units with significant improvements. This version introduces key innovations that would influence future designs.

## Key Features

- **Frame:** Identical to LifeTrac III
- **Hydraulic Motors:** Larger 45 cu in hydraulic motors (upgraded from 32 cu in)
- **Wheel System:** Modular Wheel Units with Quick Connect Wheels
- **Loader Arms:** Bent Loader Arms for improved geometry
- **Hydraulic Controls:** Quick connects added to hydraulic controls
- **Load Capacity:** Additional load carrying capacity from rear weight addition

## Major Improvements from LifeTrac III

### 1. Quick Connect Wheels
- Modular wheel attachment system
- Improved maintenance and part replacement
- Enhanced field serviceability

### 2. Bent Loader Arms
- Improved loader arm geometry
- Better loading and lifting characteristics
- Enhanced operational efficiency

### 3. Larger Hydraulic Motors
- Upgraded from 32 cu in to 45 cu in hydraulic motors
- Increased power and torque capability
- Better performance under load

### 4. Quick Connect Hydraulics
- Quick connects added to hydraulic controls
- Simplified operation and maintenance
- Enhanced modularity

## Development History

- **Last Updated:** September 9, 2012
- **Design Assistance:** GrabCAD community helped with wheel redesign
- **International Application:** Guatemala Team built LifeTrac IV with Power Cube system
- **Design Philosophy:** Retrofit approach to upgrade existing LifeTrac III units

## Historical Significance

LifeTrac IV introduced the Modular Wheel Units concept and Quick Connect systems that became fundamental to the LifeTrac philosophy of modular, serviceable design. The bent loader arms solved geometry issues from previous versions.
