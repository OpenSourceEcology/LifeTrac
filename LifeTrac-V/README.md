# LifeTrac V

**Alternative Name:** Fifth LifeTrac Iteration  
**Wiki Reference:** [LifeTrac V](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_V)

## Overview

LifeTrac V represents a significant milestone in the LifeTrac series as it began using the LifeTrac Construction Set philosophy. This version marked the standardization of construction methods and increased modularity that would define future LifeTrac designs.

## Key Features

- **Construction Standard:** Began using LifeTrac Construction Set with 4"x4" square tubing
- **Modularity:** Increased modularity of construction
- **Wheel System:** Modular Wheel Units continued from LifeTrac IV
- **Design Philosophy:** Standardized construction methods for easier replication

## Innovation: LifeTrac Construction Set

The introduction of the LifeTrac Construction Set was a major advancement:
- **Material Standard:** 4"x4" square tubing as primary structural element
- **Modularity:** Enhanced modular design for easier assembly and maintenance
- **Standardization:** Consistent construction methods across components
- **Replicability:** Simplified design for easier reproduction by other builders

## Design Evolution

LifeTrac V built upon the successful innovations of LifeTrac IV while introducing:
- Standardized construction methodology
- Enhanced modularity through the Construction Set approach
- Continued use of Modular Wheel Units
- Improved design consistency

## Historical Significance

This version established the LifeTrac Construction Set philosophy using 4"x4" square tubing, which became a foundational element for subsequent designs. The focus on modular construction made the design more accessible to builders worldwide.
