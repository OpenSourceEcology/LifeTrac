# LifeTrac VII

**Alternative Name:** First Tracked Version / Bulldozer  
**Wiki Reference:** [LifeTrac VII](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_VII) (redirects to [Bulldozer](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Bulldozer))

## Overview

LifeTrac VII represents a major departure from previous wheeled designs as the first tracked version built in the LifeTrac series. This version continued the Tractor Construction Set philosophy but adapted it for tracked bulldozer development, marking the beginning of specialized earth-moving capabilities within the LifeTrac ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Track System:** First tracked version in the LifeTrac series
- **Construction:** Continued Tractor Construction Set with 4"x4" square tubing
- **Purpose:** Specialized for earth-moving and bulldozer applications
- **Design Philosophy:** Integration of tracked mobility with modular construction

## Design Evolution

### Tracked Mobility
- Excellent ground hold and mobility through rough terrain
- Wide tracks distribute weight over large area
- Prevents sinking in sandy or muddy ground
- Enhanced traction for heavy-duty applications

### Earth-Moving Capabilities
- High-traction, earth-moving functionality
- Suitable for building ponds, berms, and other earthworks
- Road building and land clearing applications
- Integration with bulldozer blade systems

## Technical Specifications

- **Base:** Tractor Construction Set foundation
- **Mobility:** Track-based system for enhanced traction
- **Applications:** Earth-moving, bulldozing, heavy traction work
- **Design:** Lower torque variant with additional weight for stability

## Product Ecology

LifeTrac VII integrates with other GVCS components:
- **Steel:** Produced with Induction Furnace
- **Parts:** Fabricated with CNC Torch Table  
- **Assembly:** Constructed with Welder
- **Base:** Built on Tractor platform

## Historical Significance

LifeTrac VII marked the expansion of the LifeTrac concept beyond traditional tractor applications into specialized earth-moving equipment. This diversification demonstrated the flexibility of the modular construction approach.
