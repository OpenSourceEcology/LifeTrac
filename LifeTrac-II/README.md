# LifeTrac II

**Alternative Name:** Second LifeTrac Prototype  
**Wiki Reference:** [LifeTrac II](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac_II)

## Overview

The LifeTrac II was a departure from the articulated steering design in LifeTrac I to a skid steer design. This version began the modular Power Cube design that became a hallmark of the LifeTrac series. The tractor is powered by 2 Power Cubes and has 2 loaders - both on the front and on the rear of the tractor.

## Key Features

- **Steering System:** Skid steering with tracks on rubber tires
- **Drive System:** 4 wheel drive
- **Power Plant:** 2 modular engine units (Power Cubes), 54 hp total
- **Attachments:** Front-end and rear-end loaders included
- **Design Philosophy:** Beginning of modular Power Cube design

## Design Rationale

The change from articulated to skid steer design was made for several advantages:
- Greater lifting capacities
- Tighter steering in confined spaces  
- Greater flexibility on lift height
- Wider range of tool attachments

**Trade-off:** Skid steer style tractors are much harder on the ground than articulated steering tractors.

## Historical Significance

LifeTrac II marks the beginning of the modular Power Cube design philosophy that would influence all subsequent LifeTrac versions. This represented a major evolution from the single-engine design of LifeTrac I.
